# jmeter_oauth_plugin
Reincarnation of oauth1 request sampler for JMeter

Since the older version of the sampler had been working untill JMeter 3.2 I decided to revamp it in my repo

How to build:

1) Put the code of you plugin in JMETER_HOME\addons directory.
2) Copy extras\addons.xml in JMETER_HOME and modify it accordingly
3) ant -buildfile addons.xml
